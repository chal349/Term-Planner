TERM PLANNER

This mobile application was created in Android Studio using Java. Data is saved using SQLite database with Room.

* After a successful user login, the user can schedule terms, courses, and assessments. The user can also view their student report.
* The term list allows the user to add terms. Upon clicking on a specific term, the user can edit the term details and navigate to a course list for that term.
* Similar to the term list, the course list allows the user to add courses to the term. Clicking on a specific course allows the user to edit the course details and navigate to an assessment list associated with that course.
* The assessment list allows the user to add new assessments or select a specific assessment to edit the details.
* The Reports screen shows the course status of all courses a student has been enrolled in.

----------------------

Menu options for all three edit screens of term, course, and assessment allow the user to delete the selected object. 

* For courses and assessments, the user can set alerts for the start and end dates of the course or assessment. These alerts will appear even if the application is closed. 
* The Course screen also allows the user an option to share notes via Email or SMS.
